# Overview

Put your Python skills to the test, while learning the mechanics of a game engine. 
This Halloween Run quick-play game is built using PyGame, and demonstrates the fundamentals you need to learn to start mastering any game engine including:
* drawing with shapes
* displaying images
* handling user input
* basic animations & movements
* jumping & gravity
* measuring time
* using the sprite class
* adding music & sound effects

1. Clone the repo
2. Install pygame
   1. `pip install pygame` (Windows) 
   2. `pip3 install pygame` (Mac)

# Future Work

* Add levels with more/harder obstacles, rather than just a speed increase
* Add support for more customization (choose a character, choose your own obstacles, etc.)
* Optimize all images
